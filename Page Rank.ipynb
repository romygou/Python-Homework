    "### PageRank\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the most important website on the internet? Who is the \"key player\" on a sports team? Which countries are the most central players in the world economy? There is no one correct answer to any of these questions, but there is a most profitable one. [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) is an algorithm for ranking individual elements of complex systems, invited by Sergey Brin and Larry Page. It was the first and most famous algorithm used by the Google Search engine, and it is fair to say that the internet as we know it today would not exist without PageRank. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will implement PageRank. There are many good ways to implement this algorithm, but in this assignment we will use our newfound skills with object-oriented programming and iterators. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this example, let's assume that we are talking about webpages. PageRank works by allowing a \"random surfer\" to move around webpages by following links. Each time the surfer lands on a page, it then looks for all the links on that page. It then picks one at random and follows it, thereby arriving at the next page, where the process repeats. Because the surfer moves between linked pages, PageRank expresses an intuitive idea: **important pages are linked to other important pages.** [This diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank#/media/File:PageRanks-Example.jpg) from Wikipedia gives a nice illustration. Note that more important webpages (higher PageRank) tend to be connected to other important webpages. \n",

    "\" alt=\"A set of 11 circles, with arrows between them. Some of the circles are larger than others, reflecting their high PageRank score. Large circles tend to be linked to other large circles by arrows.\" width=\"300px\">\n",
    "  <figcaption><i>A schematic for PageRank. </i></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(There's a small issue related to webpages that don't have any links, which we'll address later on in the assignment. This is the \"damping factor\" in the diagram, which comes into play when we implement \"teleportation\" below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set comes from the hit Broadway musical \"Hamilton.\"\n",

    "  <figcaption><i>The Hamilton data set</i></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The good folks at [The Hamilton Project](http://hamilton.newtfire.org/) analyzed the script for us, obtaining data on **who talks about whom** in each of the show's songs. When character A mentions character B, we'll think of this as a *link* from A to B, suggesting that B might be important. \n",

    "**Answer**: The most important elements in the data set typically include hamilton, burr, washington, jefferson, eliza, jAdams, angelica, and schuylerSis. When the jump probability is lower, the number of times each state appears tends to be distributed more evenly. The jump probability doesn't have much of an affect on which states turn out to be the most important elements, only how many times they appear. Similarly, changing the initial state also doesn't seem to have much of an affect on which states turn out to be the most important elements."
